description: A short post talking about the motivation behind this page and some of my plans for it.
---

It has finally happened, I gave in to my true passion of webdesign and have made a webpage.

So what is this page all about? To be honest I don't really know yet.
As most other projects it starts of with a simple idea and then expands until one is left with something that is overcomplicating the simple thing it set out to solve.
Luckily it isn't quite there yet though.

The original plan for this site was to have a simple portfolio page where I can show of some projects have done, but then I ended up writing some tutorials that I need to publish somewhere and those aren't really projects.

Of course, I also chose to write it in Haskell which means that, even though I love Haskell, things do end up taking quite a bit longer to develop. But that is mainly because I'm not really that good at Haskell.

In the end, I guess it will end up as a combination of blog posts and projects, where I get to show of and talk about cool and interresting things I have worked with. And who knows, maybe at some point where I feel like I know them good enough, I can even talk about some of the more technical aspects of my interrests.

But all that will be for the future, and as I feel this post has started to become too long for a simple Hello world post already, I will leave you here and hope that you find something of interrest on my page.
